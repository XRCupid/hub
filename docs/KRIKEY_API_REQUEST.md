### Subject: API/SDK Access Request for XRCupid Dating Simulation App

### Email Template:

```
Hi Krikey Team,

I'm developing XRCupid, an innovative dating simulation app that helps users practice communication skills through avatar-based interactions. I'm very interested in integrating Krikey's AI-powered animations to enhance our user experience.

**Our Use Case:**
- Generate contextual animations based on conversation sentiment
- Apply realistic body language to Ready Player Me avatars
- Create smooth transitions between emotional states (confident, nervous, flirty, etc.)
- Export animations for real-time use in our Three.js-based web application

**Technical Requirements:**
- API access for programmatic animation generation
- FBX export capabilities for Three.js integration
- SDK documentation for web integration
- Ability to trigger animations based on conversation context

**Expected Volume:**
- Initially: 100-500 animation generations per day
- Growth projection: 5,000+ daily within 6 months

We're particularly excited about using Krikey to make avatar interactions feel more natural and help users develop real-world communication skills.

Could you please provide:
1. API/SDK access and documentation
2. Pricing for our expected usage
3. Integration examples for web applications
4. Any best practices for real-time avatar animation

Looking forward to partnering with Krikey!

Best regards,
