# XRCupid Integration Strategy & Task Organization
*Critical Technical Integration Phase - June 2025*

## Executive Summary

We are at the most critical technical stage of XRCupid development: integrating sophisticated user measurement systems with procedurally authored lesson content. The app observes users through multiple modalities (conversation, tone, gaze, embodiment, head movement, facial expressions) to create personalized coaching experiences.

**Core Vision:** Transform individual components into a cohesive system where measurement drives lesson creation.

---

## Current System Status

### ‚úÖ Working Components
- Hume voice prosody analysis
- Facial emotion tracking via Hume AI
- 3D avatar rendering with blendshapes
- CV analytics infrastructure
- Transcript capture system
- Individual coach personalities (Grace, Posie, Rizzo, Dougie)

### ‚ùå Broken/Non-Functional Components
- **Audio System:** Voice skipping due to audio analysis interfering with playback
- **Avatar Behavior:** NPCs don't blink naturally
- **Posture Analysis:** Not working at all
- **Eye Gaze Tracking:** Inconsistent, only "sorta tracking sometimes"
- **PiP View:** Not responsive
- **Emotional Data Flow:** Not printing consistently to transcript from prosody/voice
- **Scrubbing System:** Timeline scrubbing in reports not functional
- **Performance Graph:** Empty/not displaying data
- **Scoring System:** Mostly non-functional

### üîó Missing Integration Bridges
- Research/academic content not reflected in current system
- No connection between lesson assignments and measurement analytics
- Story banking system for narrative optimization
- Curiosity bank for conversation preparation
- Lesson objectives not programmed into Hume configs

---

## Phase 1: Critical Technical Fixes (Immediate)

### Priority 1: Audio System Resolution
**Problem:** Audio plays but frequency analysis captures zero data (`max=0, nonZero=0, playing=true`)

**Root Cause:** `createMediaElementSource()` connection not working properly

**Technical Tasks:**
- [ ] Debug Web Audio API analyzer connection timing
- [ ] Investigate CORS issues with audio blob URLs
- [ ] Check if multiple analyzer setups are conflicting
- [ ] Compare working V2 analyzer setup with current V3 implementation
- [ ] Verify AudioContext timing and state management

**Success Criteria:** 
- Logs show real values: `max=120, nonZero=64` (not zeros)
- No more "No audio frequency data detected" warnings
- Real-time lip sync based on actual audio content

### Priority 2: Avatar Behavior Systems
**Tasks:**
- [ ] Implement natural blinking system for NPCs
- [ ] Fix PiP view responsiveness
- [ ] Ensure avatar animations sync with audio data

### Priority 3: Analytics Data Flow
**Tasks:**
- [ ] Fix emotional data printing to transcripts consistently
- [ ] Repair scrubbing system in chemistry reports
- [ ] Connect performance graphs to actual data
- [ ] Debug posture analysis tracking

## Phase 2: Lesson-Analytics Bridge System

### Core Architecture Requirement
```typescript
interface LessonObjective {
  lessonId: string;
  coachPersonality: 'grace' | 'posie' | 'rizzo' | 'dougie';
  measurementType: 'nodding' | 'eyeContact' | 'posture' | 'voiceTone' | 'storyTelling';
  successCriteria: {
    minValue: number;
    duration: number; // seconds
    frequency: number; // events per minute
  };
  coachPrompts: string[];
  failureInterventions: string[];
}
```

### Measurement Integration Tasks
- [ ] **Posie Nodding Exercise:** Monitor head movement frequency during storytelling
- [ ] **Grace Eye Contact:** Track gaze percentage on avatar face during conversations
- [ ] **Story Optimization:** Analyze speech pace, tone variation, engagement hooks
- [ ] **Posture Coaching:** Real-time feedback on body language and presence

---

## Phase 3: Hume Configuration Programming

### Strategy: Lesson-Specific Configs
Create dedicated Hume EVI configurations for specialized training:

### Config Categories to Create

#### 1. Story Banking Config
**Purpose:** Elicit and optimize user storytelling
**System Prompt Template:**
```
You are [Coach Name], expert in narrative engagement and storytelling mastery.

Lesson Objective: Help user discover, refine, and perfect their personal stories.

Your approach:
1. Ask curiosity-provoking questions to uncover stories
2. Guide story structure (setup, conflict, resolution, lesson)
3. Coach on pacing, emotional range, and audience engagement
4. Provide real-time feedback on delivery

Success Metrics: Story has clear arc, emotional variation in voice, appropriate pacing
Failure Interventions: Gentle coaching on specific storytelling elements
```

#### 2. Curiosity Bank Config
**Purpose:** Develop habit of self-curation and interesting conversation topics
**Conversation Starters:**
- "What's been capturing your attention lately?"
- "Any fascinating rabbit holes you've gone down recently?"
- "What podcasts, articles, or movies have sparked your curiosity?"
- "What's a story you've been dying to tell someone?"

#### 3. Active Listening Training Config (Posie)
**Purpose:** Nodding and engagement coaching during storytelling
**System Prompt:**
```
Tell engaging 2-minute story with strategic pauses.
Monitor user's nodding frequency and provide feedback.
Success: User nods at least 3 times during story.
Intervention: "A nod can help show you're following along."
```

#### 4. Eye Contact Mastery Config (Grace)
**Purpose:** Sustained eye contact during conversation
**Integration:** WebGazer eye tracking + real-time coaching

#### 5. Posture & Presence Config
**Purpose:** Body language optimization
**Integration:** ML5 posture tracking + coaching feedback

### Configuration Creation Tasks
- [ ] Create Story Banking Hume config
- [ ] Create Curiosity Development config  
- [ ] Create Active Listening config (Posie-specific)
- [ ] Create Eye Contact Training config (Grace-specific)
- [ ] Create Posture Coaching config

2. **Scoring Algorithm:** Should scoring be absolute or relative to user's baseline performance?

3. **Coach Personality Integration:** How do we maintain distinct coach personalities while delivering specific lesson content?

4. **User Agency:** How much control should users have over which aspects they want to measure vs. automatic measurement?

5. **Privacy & Data:** How do we handle sensitive story content and personal revelations in the banking system?
