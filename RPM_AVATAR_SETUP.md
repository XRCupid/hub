# üé≠ Ready Player Me Avatar Integration

## Overview
XRCupid now supports Ready Player Me (RPM) 3D avatars for realistic video chat simulations. The system includes fallback geometric avatars when RPM URLs are not available.

## Current Status
‚úÖ **Fully Integrated** - RPM avatars work throughout the dating simulation flow  
‚úÖ **Emotion System** - Avatars respond to conversation emotions via Hume AI  
‚úÖ **Fallback System** - Animated geometric avatars when RPM URLs fail  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Demo Mode** - Currently showing fallback avatars (need real RPM URLs)  

## Where to See Avatars
1. **Dating Simulation** ‚Üí Match with someone ‚Üí Chat ‚Üí **Video Date**
2. The 3D avatar appears in the video call interface
3. Facial expressions change based on conversation emotions
4. Avatars have realistic lip-sync and blendshape animations

## How to Add Real RPM Avatars

### Step 1: Create Avatars
1. Visit [readyplayer.me](https://readyplayer.me)
2. Create free avatars for your NPCs (Alex, Jamie, Sam, River)
3. Copy the `.glb` URLs (format: `https://models.readyplayer.me/your-avatar-id.glb`)

### Step 2: Update Avatar URLs
Edit `/src/utils/rpmAvatars.ts` and replace the empty URLs:

```typescript
export const DEMO_RPM_AVATARS: RPMAvatarConfig[] = [
  {
    id: 'demo-male-1',
    name: 'Alex',
    gender: 'male',
    style: 'realistic',
    url: 'https://models.readyplayer.me/YOUR-ALEX-AVATAR-ID.glb' // ‚Üê Add real URL here
  },
  // ... repeat for other characters
];
```

### Step 3: Test the Integration
1. Run `npm start`
2. Navigate to Dating Simulation
3. Match with someone and start a video date
4. You should see realistic 3D avatars instead of geometric shapes

## Technical Features

### Emotion Mapping
- **Joy**: Big smile + raised eyebrows
- **Anger**: Furrowed brows + nostril flare  
- **Sadness**: Drooped mouth + lowered brows
- **Surprise**: Wide eyes + raised brows
- **Fear**: Tense expression + wide eyes
- **Disgust**: Wrinkled nose + slight frown
- **Contempt**: Asymmetric smirk
- **Excitement**: Enhanced joy with energy
- **Amusement**: Gentle smile + eye crinkles

### Components
- **RPMAvatar**: Main 3D avatar renderer with emotion system
- **RPMAvatarCreator**: User interface for avatar selection/creation
- **RPMVideoCall**: Enhanced video call with 3D avatars
- **FallbackAvatar**: Animated geometric avatar when RPM fails

### Error Handling
- Graceful fallback to geometric avatars
- Network error recovery
- Invalid URL detection
- Loading state management

## Development Notes

### Performance
- Uses @react-three/fiber for efficient 3D rendering
- GLTFLoader with proper error handling
- Optimized emotion blendshape calculations
- Minimal re-renders with React.memo

### Debugging
- Console logs show avatar loading status
- Setup instructions logged when no URLs provided
- Visual indicators for fallback vs real avatars
- Error messages for troubleshooting

## Future Enhancements
- [ ] User avatar creation flow
- [ ] Avatar customization options
- [ ] Voice-driven lip sync improvements
- [ ] Additional emotion expressions
- [ ] Avatar outfit/appearance changes
- [ ] Group video calls with multiple avatars

## Troubleshooting

**Q: I see geometric shapes instead of realistic avatars**  
A: This means you're in fallback mode. Add real RPM URLs to see realistic avatars.

**Q: Avatar emotions don't change**  
A: Check that Hume AI is connected and providing emotion data.

**Q: Avatar doesn't load**  
A: Verify the RPM URL is valid and the .glb file is accessible.

**Q: Performance issues**  
A: Try using lower quality RPM avatars or reduce the number of simultaneous avatars.
